## Why is Jenkins great:
1. Jenkins Lowers The Effort Of Converting CLI To GUI
Everybody loves one-button click philosophy. Both users and engineers. The truth is lots of system admins prefer CLI.
So why? Is it because all of the IT professionals are nerds and jerks? Well, maybe…
Implementing reliable scripts takes time. But adding decent UI support takes even longer. (Add comments if you have other opinions).
Now with Jenkins, visual Ops is much easier to achieve.
    To convert a CLI into a GUI button click, just wrap up the script as a Jenkins job.
    To support customization and obtain users’ input? Create parameterized Jenkins jobs.
